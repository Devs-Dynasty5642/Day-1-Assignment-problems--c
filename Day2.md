# Problem 1

If lengths of three sides of a triangle are input through the keyboard, write a program to find the area of the triangle.

# Problem 2

If a five-digit number is input through the keyboard, write a program to reverse the number.

# Problem 3

Consider a currency system in which there are notes of six denominations, namely, Re. 1, Rs. 2, Rs. 5, Rs. 10, Rs. 50, Rs. 100. If a sum of Rs. N is entered through the keyboard, write a program to compute the smallest number of notes that will combine to give Rs. N.

# Problem 4

Write a program to receive values of latitude (L1, L2) and longitude (G1, G2), in degrees, of two places on the earth and output the distance (D) between them in nautical miles. The formula for distance in nautical miles is:
D = 3963 *cos^ -1.( sin L1. sin L2 + cos L1. cos L2 * cos (G2-G1))
