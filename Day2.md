# Problem 3
Consider a currency system in which there are notes of six denominations, namely, Re. 1, Rs. 2, Rs. 5, Rs. 10, Rs. 50, Rs. 100. If a sum of Rs. N is entered through the keyboard, write a program to compute the smallest number of notes that will combine to give Rs. N.

# Homework Problems

## (a)
If a five-digit number is input through the keyboard, write a program to calculate the sum of its digits. (Hint: Use the modulus operator `%`.)

## (b)
Write a program to receive Cartesian coordinates (x, y) of a point and convert them into polar coordinates (r, φ).
- Hint: 
  - \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \)
  - \( φ = \arctan\left(\frac{y}{x}\right) \)

## (c)
Write a program to receive values of latitude (L1, L2) and longitude (G1, G2), in degrees, of two places on the earth and output the distance (D) between them in nautical miles.
- The formula for distance in nautical miles is:
